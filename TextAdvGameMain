    '''
    Quick idea for how to run each room
    Have each room be a function that has variables set to decide what 
    variations need to be present
    For instance a player walks into a room
    the player has done x but not y 
    if those x and/or y effect that room, there will be something different
    say the player had already done something in there like
    lighting a torch or taking an item
    this will keep it from forcing the player to redo it
    the only alternative I can think of for this would be to have a
    insane amount of variables that have been custom made for each 
    possible command the player makes
    of course that would take ages and is pretty much
    impossible
