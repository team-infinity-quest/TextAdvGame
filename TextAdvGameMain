This will help us keep track of updates
Please update the number bellow and include what number the update is 
in your commit on GitHub as you will see in the commit for this update
Oh and you do not need to update the number if you only change like 1 line of code
Version 0.001

    Quick idea for how to run each room
    Have each room be a function that has variables set to decide what 
    variations need to be present
    For instance a player walks into a room
    the player has done x but not y 
    if those x and/or y effect that room, there will be something different
    say the player had already done something in there like
    lighting a torch or taking an item
    this will keep it from forcing the player to redo it
    the only alternative I can think of for this would be to have a
    insane amount of variables that have been custom made for each 
    possible command the player makes
    of course that would take ages and is pretty much
    impossible

We need a way to have the next room load after the player opens the door.
After picking the lock the player will unlock the door and be able to
enter the next room. Sadely I, Ethan do not know how to do that
without making the function bellow this function.
Which of course causes issues for obvious reasons.
If anyone can develop a way to load the next room and keep everything that
was done in the previous room, please do so and upload it to our Github.
Also I would recomend saying if your working on it in our Discord chat,
that should help us keep out of eachothers work.
Oh and I moved this here because Python was being weird and acted like this 
comment was destroying the code or something.
'''  
            
'''
Here is a start of what the next room will be.
Sadley since we have yet to connect this to the previous room
we will be unable to test stuff here. If you add anything here
please keep that in mind. Also try not to add anything to compelx here
this is still an early part of the game, we need to make sure the player
knows at least the basics of how to play our game.
From, Ethan
